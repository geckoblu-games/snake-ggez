This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple Snake game 
in the [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language step-by-step using [`ggez`](https://ggez.rs/).

I'm currently learning both Rust and ggez so what follows is my best understanding
of both but don't necessary the best way for do it.
Suggestions and corrections are always welcome.

At the time of writing Rust is at `2021` edition and ggez is at version `0.8.1`.
I will try to keep this tutorial up-to-date.

The complete source code of this tutorial is available [`here`](https://github.com/geckoblu-games/snake-ggez).
See also the `examples` for the code of the various lessons.
